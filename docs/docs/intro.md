# Tutorial Intro

Let's discover **SyncSip**.

## What is it 

SyncSip is a system that makes your espresso data driven. It is an extension that fits onto all espresso machines that have an interface to read the pressure from the brew chamber.
The system enables you to see and analyze the insights of your extraction and create a shot history in order to view your extractions.

## What parts is it made of

SyncSip is a system that right now consists of some hardware and software. The hardware parts are a scale and a pressure sensor. As a scale i chose to integrate the Bookoo Themis mini but more scales will follow.
The pressure sensor is DIY and i have included tutorials of how to build it.

If you equip your espresso machine with the pressure sensor you can start using the product. The data is being visualized in a mobile app that you can find for free in the app and play store.

## What is the building process like ? 

The only think that you really have to build is the pressure sensor, it requires soldering and optionally 3d printing. The 3D printied structures are so simple that if you don't have access to a printer you can consider building the case in an alternative way.

So you would order the parts from the Bills of Materials and start soldering them together as shown in the tutorial. After that you can flash the microcontroller with the software and start connecting to the sensor from the Synsip App.

The building process can easily be done in a day and all you need is very basic soldering knowledge that you can learn from Youtube tutorials as i did.

## Two paths

There are essentially two ways you can use these docs, one way is to simply replicate the project and the other way is to truly understand the project and potentially make changes by yourself if you see room for improvement.
I have called these different parts the **User-Docs** and **Contributor-Docs**.
