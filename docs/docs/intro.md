# Tutorial Intro

Let's discover **SyncSip** and learn how to use this documentation website.

## What is it 

SyncSip is a system that makes your espresso data driven. It is an extension that fits onto all espresso machines that have an interface to read the pressure from the brew chamber.
The system enables you to see and analyze the insights of your extraction and create a shot history in order to view your extractions.

## What parts is it made of

SyncSip is a system that right now consists of some hardware and software. The hardware parts are a scale and a pressure sensor. As a scale i chose to integrate the Bookoo Themis mini but more scales will follow.
The pressure sensor is DIY and i have included tutorials of how to build it.

If you equip your espresso machine with the pressure sensor you can start using the product. The data is being visualized in a mobile app that you can find for free in the app and play store.

## What is the building process like ? 

The only thing that you really have to yourself is the pressure sensor, it requires soldering and optionally 3d printing. The 3D printied structures are so simple that if you don't have access to a printer you can consider building the case in an alternative way.

So you would order the parts from the Bills of Materials and start soldering them together as shown in the tutorial. After that you can flash the microcontroller with the software and start connecting to the sensor from the Synsip App.

The building process can easily be done in a day and all you need is very basic soldering knowledge that you can learn from Youtube tutorials as i did.

## Before you start building

There are two approaches how you can use this project.

**Option one**: the user:
You should go this path if you just want to start brewing data driven coffee **ASAP**, you will not learn how the project works under the hood but the brewing experience will be exactly the same, so enjoy!

**Option two**: the contributor: 
If you really want to understand how the project works and maybe even make changes or contribute to the project you should follow this path. I will explain how the project works to enable you to build on top of that.

I have called these different paths the **User-Docs** and **Contributor-Docs**.
