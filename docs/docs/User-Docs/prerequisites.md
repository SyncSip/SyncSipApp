# Prerequisites

This project does not require deep technical knowledge for simply building your instance of the product. 
What you really need are basic soldering skills, all the materials, a computer and a little bit of patience and enthusiasm.

## Build process

### Pressure Sensor
I would start with the pressure sensor, it is the hardest part to build it will cost you the most time.
After building this sensor you essentially only need to download an app and start brewing coffee!

### Scale
The Bookoo themis mini is integrated into the app and i would recommend using it, it is the cheapest espresso scale on the market but
we will continue to integrate more scales into this app.

### Software
To download the app simply go to the app or play store and download it.

### Enjoy
Enjoy having more insights into your coffee extraction
